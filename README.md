# WaterQualityMonitor
Rapid, accurate and inexpensive monitoring of water quality parameters is essential for continued water safety in resource-limited areas. 
Most conventional sensing methods can only monitor one parameter at a time, and lack user-friendliness and on-site monitoring capabilities. 
A handheld water quality monitoring system with an array of electrochemical sensors is a promising solution to this problem. 
Therefore, we propose to develop a low-cost, easy-to-use and highly sensitive sensor array in a portable, pocket-sized configuration that can continuously monitor major water quality parameters such as pH, total chlorine, temperature, and several relevant ions. 
The proposed sensing system will be comprised of a fully-integrated electrochemical sensor array that will offer simultaneous monitoring of pH (sensitivity of 0.1 pH), total chlorine (sensitivity of 0.1 ppm), temperature (sensitivity of 0.1 Â°C), and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions (sensitivity of 1 mg/L). 
The proposed research will bridge the technological gap between signal transduction, processing, wireless-transmission and smartphone interfacing. 
The system will be developed by merging nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes and ion sensitive membranes-based sensors fabricated on flexible substrates, which will be controlled by a custom-designed readout circuit and Android application. 
This device will eliminate the use of expensive laboratory-based techniques and trained personnel. 
Also, the sensing system can be easily modified and programmed to integrate other sensors, a capability that can be exploited to monitor a wide range of water quality parameters. 
We will demonstrate the integrated system for monitoring drinking water and recreational waters. 
This system will open possibilities for a wide range of low-cost and ubiquitous environmental monitoring applications.
